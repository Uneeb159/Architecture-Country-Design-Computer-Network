🌐 Enterprise Network Infrastructure (Cisco Packet Tracer)
📌 Project Overview

This project represents a multi-site enterprise network design implemented in Cisco Packet Tracer. The network simulates a real-world corporate environment with multiple international locations, department-wise VLAN segmentation, centralized services, and scalable IP addressing using DHCP.
It covers network planning, VLAN segmentation, routing, and core server services with a structured and scalable approach.

All diagrams are stored in the Screenshots/ folder and are displayed after their respective explanations.

🏗️ Overall Network Design

This diagram represents the high-level architecture of the network, showing how core devices, distribution layers, and access networks are interconnected to form a unified system.
